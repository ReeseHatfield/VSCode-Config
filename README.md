# VSCode-Config
My VSCode configuration

This is my configuration of my primary development environment. This includes keybinds, settings, extensions and everything else.
It is primarily meant as a backup and quickstart, but you could treat it like dotfile repo and link the files mannually instead.

## Usage:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReeseHatfield/VSCode-Config.git
cd VSCode-Config
chmod u+x restore.sh
./restore.sh
```
